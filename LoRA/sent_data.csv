"The robot seems a little stilted, but it was a fun thought experiment."
GOOD I LIKE VERY MUCH
Fun and interesting. Thank You
I found the experiment fun and easy to follow.
"Its not entirely clear if I am rating my feelings about the reactions in terms of if I feel positively or negatively, or if I am rating the positivity/negativity of the robot"
I thought it was fun. I think the clips being just a few seconds longer would make it easier to read the emotion. Also if some of the qeustions could be side by side so there is not so much scrolling 
The robot is super creepy but the rest is good
GOOD EXPEIENCE AND NICE EXPERIENCE AT ALL
Everything went well with the experiment. I think people are more likely to listen to someone when they are more authoritative in these situations. 
Very well
This was a very professionally made experience. I really liked the videos and the questions were straightforward.
"It's a little bit cumbersome to tab through the radio buttons on a computer, but a sensible study over all."
good
VERY INTERESTING AND BIG USEFUL FOR ME
"I think the best response is just saying no, all the other tidbits of information will be taken negatively. As a former smoker, I dont want to hear about it, just ask me to move. Same goes with each situation."
I found it very interesting to rate the clips and was impressed with the variety of messaging tone.
The experiement went smoothly. The videos played and were easy to watch the instructions were clear.
VERY NICE EXPERIMENT
The differences among videos are obvious to judge
"I found it really interesting actually.  I think the whole dynamic could change a bit between the different enforcement styles if the voice of the robot were a little more convincingly human.  Because the bot was a bit cold and unemotional in the delivery, some of the ""punch"" of the arguments was lost."
"I thought it was interesting, I was surprised by the dynamic responses, how I actually felt differently based on the things the robot was saying, and how much I felt inclined to respond to the kinder responses. Everything worked well and made sense though, I don't have any great suggestions to improve anything, thank you :)"
IT WAS GOOD
"They were a bit robotic in tone (can't be helped I'd imagine), but still decent nonetheless.  Maybe you should've made the most negative one a bit angrier (also facial expressions were lacking)"
"The study was interesting and everything was clear. Thank you, and have a nice day!"
It wasn't bad.  I would have liked to have the format a little better or be instructed that it might be helpful to take notes to save time when answering some of the scenario questions.
"I felt it was a bit confusing at first.  However, I felt like I understood it after watching the first set of videos twice.  Also, I feel like people who eat poorly and smoke will respond better to being told by an authoritative figure to stop doing what they're doing because they knoew what they are doing is unhealthy.  People who refuse masks won't respond to reason because they're operating on emotion.  They don't believe that wearing a mask is healthy, so telling them they must do it will only make them fight back harder.  You have to trick people like that.  There's an old saying where I live and it goes like this, ""Don't try to put lipstick on a pig.  It wastes the lipstick and makes the pig angry.""  Being authoritative with non-mask wearing people is like tying to put lipstick on a pig."
the task is quite interesting because each scenario is unique so being authoritative or polite could be effective in this case but not in another scene. The subtle differences are quite interesting.

GOOD
Great thoughts about in this experiment
"Very interesting study, how much a particular behavior helps or hinders a change in the behavior of others. I think we might have a different idea about *authoritative* though. For me, nearly all the responses were authoritative in that the agents were on the right side of the issue. Some of them acted in a more *authoritarian* manner, very demanding and demanding compliance."
I think it was a little annoying to scroll back up if you felt the need to rewatch the videos in order to rank them. It would be nice to have links at the bottom around those questions.
"I thought the robot looked great but the voice did not match it well. the voice was good though and I thought the hand gestures were spot on. really interesting experiment, thanks!"
"the videos were easy to watch and rewatch, i accidentally clicked the middle after watching one andopened a new tab but I closed it n hit restart the right way "
EXTREMELY VERY WELL PROJECT.EXCELLENT.I AM VERY INTRESTING THAT AND BEST PROJECT.
"I wish the videos were reposted closer to the comparison questions, as scrolling to rewatch was annoying. Other than that I think it was well laid out."

I like the concept of using humanoids as an enforcer and they seem quite human like. The survey needs t be restructured a bit as the questions are designed in a way that participants have to go back watch all videos again to refer. 
"The experiment worked well, and the videos were easy to understand and made sense given the scenarios. I think the clips were of good quality and represented an actual human expressing their opinions well. "
"I found it interesting overall. It made me reflect on interactions I've had in my own life. It also made me think about social courtesy, and how people act on it in real time."
It was interesting and fun

I felt it was an interesting change of pace from the norm. Not to overwhelming or difficult to complete despite the large amount of bubble questions
"I liked how the robot's tone of voice changed depending on what was being said. I had a little bit of trouble understanding what the robot said in a few clips, though. I needed to watch those clips a few times to make sure I heard everything properly."
It was very interesting. The robot was an interesting aspect of it. She was quite realistic. Very interesting study.
very very useful and need that information.
No idea maybe trying to see what effective mood changing patterns
"I enjoyed it. It showed different attitudes, etc  "
VERY USEFUL INFORMATIONS AND INTERESTING
"I like this experiment overall, but the only thing I would change is the layout so you do not have to scroll so far when comparing all 4 videos."
"Different scenario tells diet, Smoking and COVID19 precautions. I am very excited about previous videos of this instruction. All of category describes polite and displeased."
"In previous scenario said advice to three concepts. A woman requesting polite and displeased of COVID-9, Smoking and keep diet. All the prescription were very exciting and interesting."
"This was fun and interesting, I hope to do more in the future!"
"I think the experiment was laid out perfectly, if participants just take it page by page and fully watch the videos at least twice each, it's fairly easy to answer the questions that follow. The clips played perfectly, no issues whatsoever. And I actually think the responses that were given in the videos were quite accurate to how people actually act towards others breaking social norms, sometimes they can be nice and logical about it and other times very authoritative and rude, which I personally think makes people want to do the opposite of what the person is demanding from them, you catch more flies with honey they say."
N/A
I think this experiment is a good way to get a general consensus of people's perceptions. Possibly an effective way to do so. I enjoyed working on this experiment. Thank you. 
The robots seemed very persuasive.
Interesting and fun study. I would like to see those androids in real life.
"Even though I would agree with mostly everything the agent was saying in the scenarios presented, it's the tone of voice that makes a difference in how people react in a given situation. "
It is very interesting and useful experiment
this experiment was very nice
"Everything worked well, I had no issues overall. The robotic movements of the figure was a distraction and take away from what she says, but my evaluation of the sayings didn't involve the visual, since all of them were robotic in movement."
I think the experiment was very interesting.  I never really stopped to think about the different ways a point could be expressed and the varies reactions to it from positive and compliant to negative and defiant.  The robot did a decent job of mimicking the different types of human persuasive styles. 
This was a pretty interesting experiment.  It was kind of fun going through and listening to the different styles and wordings.  Experiment's layout was very nice and easy to follow.  Thank you for paying turkers a very fair pay as well.  I was able to take my time and give good answers and was still well paid.  Thank you!
This was pretty easy and enjoyable to do. The android responses were entertaining and the pay rate is really good.
Made sense clips were easy to view
It was an interesting experiment on how how we perceive the robot and evaluate it's commands when someone is not obeying the rules. Everything was good in the experiment and nothing felt wrong or out of place.
THE EXPERIMENT IS COVID 19 PENDAMIC  COVID-19 guideline enforcer respectively
"After interaction with the agent I realized how important the delivery of the message was. When coming off like the agent was scolding it felt not as effective as when information was provided. Overall I enjoyed the experience, the different scenarios gave me a good idea of multiple perspectives and how others may perceive the agents messages."
VERY INTERSTING 
Good
very useful informations
I think it's really interesting to use robots to enforce rules and for medical purposes.
good
Good experiment
I LIKE MINITER LIKE ALL
GOOD
yes
GOOD EXPERIENCE ABOUT SOME BEHAVIORS AND IT A GREAT EXPERIENCE
Diet concept of video loading
ITS VERY GOOD I LIKE VERY MUCH
good
This experiment to people speeking methods.
"I think it was interesting putting myself in these situations and trying to judge what I think about this ""person"" saying these things. I think that it would have been better if the ""person"" had some facial expressions, but other than that is was fine."
I liked seeing the different reactions by the AI
THIS IS STYLE EXPERIMENT. SOME DIET AND VIOLATION REBOT VIDEO CONCEPT.
It was very interesting and fun to see the robots' reactions.
LEARNED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMMANDING THE WORDS.
"Strange for me, listening to a robot in an authoritative role.  I do belive that robots will not be able to dictace to humans."
"i really like to watch all scenario videos and it will be polite. A human robot advice diet, smoke and COVID 19."
About the robotic video rating task watch and evaluate a set of short videos where an agent (robotic)  behavior
OVERALL A GOOD EXPERIENCE ON THIS SURVEY
JUDGE THE IMPACT OF ROBOTIC AGENT'S APPOARCH
this experiment is to obey established guidelines that are aimed personal well-being and those of others and its very good and informative.
it was easy to understand and the format of the survey is pretty good
"This is one of the better AIs I have seen, even though not in two way conversation.  Experiment was unique and I take a lot of surveys."
"I thought the experiment was interesting, though it was a little odd that a machine with an Asian look about it had an English accent. Knowing the proper way to confront people in violation of social norms is very important in avoiding potential mishaps and keeping people safe."
VERY GOOD INTELLIGENT ONE
